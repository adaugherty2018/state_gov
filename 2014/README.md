# state_gov_2014

All data was collected from the website of each applicable Secretary of State.

The initial data used for preliminary compilation was obtained from the Harvard Dataverse: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/B51MPX. This data contains significant discrepancies in total vote counts for many of the states, some files are broken down by electoral districts or town/city, and Kansas is only aggregating to the state level. Therefore, this data was not useable in it's current state.

Notes:
Maine SOS did not count qualified 'emergency utility workers' and 'uniformed and overseas citizens' toward their applicable counties. 77 total votes are not categorized by county as a result.

The New Hampshire Secretary of State's election results page is undergoing maintenance at the time of this writing and only has official results posted for 2020.
- New Hampshire's 2014 public numbers exclude Grafton county's third-party votes (69 total)
